demo2 = Now we can select the number of players in this game, let's try with 1 player...
demo3 = We can see the configuration screen of the 1 player mode that we will use in the following.
demo4 = This time we select the 2-player mode and arrive on this screen, however when we try to start the game nothing happens ...
demo5 = This is due to the fact that both players had the same color which is not possible! Now that we've changed it, let's start the game by clicking "Start Playing".
demo6 = Here we are on the board, on the left we can see information about the two players, in the center the game board and on the top right a space to enter the moves, let's enter 4 in the space in the center of the arrows and let's lean on the one on the top left.
demo7 = We can see that our pawn 4 has been moved and that the name of the player in the space at the top right has been changed, so it's up to the other player to play! (we can also see that a line has been added in the history at the bottom left). Let's go back to the 1 player mode menu.
demo8 = We are going to choose to play with level 2 and therefore change the level in the drop-down menu (as before, we check the case "assisted pawns displacement" to be able to use the arrows).
demo9 = Now that that's done, let's start the game!
demo10 = Now that we've played, the computer will make its move alone:
demo11 = You can see he's moved his number 11 pawn well. You are now ready to play Zen l'Initié and go back to the menu to start your own game (don't forget that you can see the rules of the game at any time, to get more help start a game then click on ? -> Help in the menu)!
